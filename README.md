# Description
HotSpot is a pre-RTL thermal simulator intended for use early in the design process. HotSpot supports simulation of traditional 2D Integrated Circuits (2D ICs) and [3D ICs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_integrated_circuit) as well as  [microfluidic cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfluidics). If this is your first time seeing HotSpot, check out our [Getting Started](https://github.com/uvahotspot/HotSpot/wiki/Getting-Started) page. To see HotSpot in action, check out our simulation examples in the `examples` directory! Please send questions, comments, concerns, bugs, etc. to hotspot@virginia.edu.
