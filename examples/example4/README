This test case presents an example of using detailed_3D mode in 
HotSpot. It includes the following contents:

1. Layer Configurtion Files & Floorplan Files:
---------------------------------------------
    ev6_3D.lcf:            The layer configuration file for the testcase;
    ev6_3D_core_layer.flp: The flp file for core layer of the chip;
    ev6_3D_cache_<1/2>.flp:  The flp file for cache layers of the chip;
    ev6_3D_TIM.flp:        The thermal interface material layer between the logic layer and heat spreader.
    ev6_3D_TIM_TSV.flp:    The thermal interface material layer between logic layers (core layer and cache layers).
    
3. Description of the Test Case:
--------------------------------
    We assume that the system in this test case contains 4 ev6 cores 
    and a shared L2 cache. All of the 4 cores are located on the same
    layer while the L2 cache is split into 2 cache layers. Since the 
    core layer has higher power dissipation, we put this layer closer
    to the heat sink.

    In this test case, the TSV unit contains only the connection 
    between L1 caches and L2 caches. The cache block is 64 Byte, 
    which means 512 TSVs in each TSV unit. The TSV diameter is 20um, 
    and the side-to-side pitch is 40um (we assume the TSVs are 
    organized as 128*4 array, there are plenty of space in between). 
    Then we calculate the joint thermal resistance of the TSVs block 
    and put it in the flp file.

    This test case consists of a total of 6 layers: ev6_3D_cache_1 (Silicon), ev6_3D_TIM_TSV (Thermal Interface 
    Material), ev6_3D_cache_2 (Silicon), ev6_3D_TIM_TSV, 
    ev6_3D_core_layer (Silicon), and ev6_3D_TIM. The layouts of all 
    layers are shown in ev6_3d.pdf according to their sequence in the
    layer configuration file (ev6_3D.lcf).
